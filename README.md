## Art Gallery Project

This is a web app we built for managing an art gallery as part of our CSC 341 project at Furman. It lets you add buyers, artworks, sales, and mailing list entries through clean, interactive forms. The app checks for things like valid ZIP codes, prevents duplicate entries, and gives friendly error messages when something goes wrong. It’s built with Flask and connects to an Oracle database behind the scenes — simple, smooth, and designed to actually make your life easier.
